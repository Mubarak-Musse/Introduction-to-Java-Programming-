# Chpater 2 Note

```
the focuse of this chapter is on leanring elementary programming techniques to solve problems 
 
```
1. Writing a prgram requires designing a strategy for solvoing the problem then using a programminglanguage to implements that strategy. 
2. Writing a program ivolves designing algorithms and translating algorithms into programs /code 
    a. algorithms can be described in natural languages or in pseudocode ( Natural laugage mixed with somecode)
3. a variable represent a vaue stored in the computer's memory 
4.  premitive data types /fundamental types = java allows its user to store its memeroy using variable decalration 

5. be aware that variable always crospond to memery location, every variable has the follwoign 

    a.Name 
    b.type
    c.value
      
6. More information will follow below this line
